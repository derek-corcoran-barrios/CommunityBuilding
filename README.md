The goal of the CommunityBuilding repository is to thoroughly document
the generation of community data for Denmark. This includes several
processes

1.  Taxonomic cleaning
2.  Presence extraction
3.  Buffer generation
4.  Simple Nature type SDM
5.  Potential community generation
6.  Summary metrics
